# What is DragDoll?

DragDoll is a modular and highly extensible drag system written in TypeScript. Originally based on [Muuri](https://muuri.dev/)'s internal drag system, it has been fully redesigned to serve as a general-purpose drag system.

At its core, DragDoll is built on the concept of [_sensors_](/docs/sensor), which are responsible for listening to user input events (or any events, for that matter) and emitting drag events based on those inputs. While DragDoll comes with a few built-in sensors, you can also create your own to listen to any kind of input events you desire.

To actually move elements around, DragDoll provides the [`Draggable`](/docs/draggable) class. This class acts as an orchestrator for any number of sensors and moves DOM elements based on the drag events emitted by the provided sensors. The [`Draggable`](/docs/draggable) class features a simple and functional API that allows you to control the drag process explicitly from start to finish.

## Motivation

Drag and drop is hard. DragDoll aims to make it less so.

More specifically, DragDoll is an attempt to provide a simple, flexible, and powerful drag system that can be used to build a wide variety of drag-and-drop interfaces. It's designed to be easy to use, easy to extend, and easy to integrate into any kind of project.

## Features

üì° &nbsp; **Sweet Sensors**: A well-documented and extendable Sensor system that normalizes any input into unified drag events, giving you complete control over user interactions.

ü§è &nbsp; **Dynamic Draggables**: A highly customizable and pluggable Draggable system with autoscrolling superpowers, making complex drag-and-drop scenarios effortless.

ü™Ñ &nbsp; **Magical Transforms**: Finally, transformed (2D) elements can be dragged normally. Rotate, scale, skew, and translate to your heart's content without limitations.

üßò &nbsp; **Blissful DX**: Experience a seamless developer experience with strong typing, smart defaults, and pre-baked solutions for common use cases.

üç¶ &nbsp; **Vanilla Flavour**: No frameworks were abused while writing this library. It's all vanilla framework-free TypeScript down to the core.

üíù &nbsp; **Free & Open Source**: 100% MIT licensed, spread the love.

## Roadmap

- **Droppable API**: At the moment, DragDoll does not perform any collision detection, and thus no "droppable" system is provided out of the box. However, you can implement one yourself. Adding a built-in droppable system is on the roadmap and is a high-priority feature.

- **Utilizing Native Drag and Drop**: By not using the native HTML Drag and Drop API, DragDoll misses out on crucial features like file drag-and-drop and dragging items between different windows. It's still a bit unclear how to integrate the native API with DragDoll in a clear and ergonomic way, but figuring this out is a high priority for us.
