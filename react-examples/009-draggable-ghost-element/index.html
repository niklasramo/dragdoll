      content="A commong drag and drop pattern is using a temporary 'ghost' element during the drag operation while letting the actual draggable element stay in the DOM as is. This example demonstrates how easy it is to accomplish that with DragDoll. The first step is _conjuring_ (it's up to you how) the ghost element within the `elements` option and aligning it visually with the draggable element. Then just return the ghost element (in an array) instead of the draggable element in the `elements` callback. Finally, on drag `end` event, you'll need to align the draggable element with the ghost element and hide/remove the ghost element. That's it. This way you have full programmatic power to build any kind of custom scenario with your ghost elements."
