DragDoll is a modular and highly extensible drag system written in TypeScript. It's originally based on [Muuri's](https://github.com/haltu/muuri) internal drag system, but fully redesigned to be used as a general purpose drag system.

📡 &nbsp; **Sweet Sensors**

A well-documented and extendable Sensor system that normalizes any input into unified drag events, giving you complete control over user interactions.

🤏 &nbsp; **Dynamic Draggables**

A highly customizable and pluggable Draggable system with autoscrolling superpowers, making complex drag-and-drop scenarios effortless.

🪄 &nbsp; **Magical Transforms**

Finally, transformed (2D) elements can be dragged normally. Rotate, scale, skew, and translate to your heart's content without limitations.

🧘 &nbsp; **Blissful DX**

Experience a seamless developer experience with strong typing, smart defaults, and pre-baked solutions for common use cases.

🍦 &nbsp; **Vanilla Flavour**

No frameworks were abused while writing this library. It's all vanilla framework-free TypeScript down to the core.

💝 &nbsp; **Free & Open Source**
