# DragDoll

DragDoll is a modular and highly extensible drag & drop system written in TypeScript. It's based on [Muuri's](https://github.com/haltu/muuri) internal drag system, but redesigned to be used as a general purpose drag & drop system.

- Carefully designed modular API with best possible DX in mind.
- Written in TypeScript with good type inference.
- Small footprint (weighs around 11kB gzipped with all features included).
- MIT licensed.
