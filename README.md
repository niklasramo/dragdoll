# DragDoll

DragDoll is a modular and highly extensible drag & drop system written in TypeScript. It's originally based on [Muuri's](https://github.com/haltu/muuri) internal drag & drop system, but fully redesigned to be used as a general purpose drag & drop system.

📡 &nbsp; **Sweet Sensors**

A well documented and extendable Sensor system that normalizes any inputs into unified drag events.

🤏 &nbsp; **Dynamic Draggables**

A highly customizable and pluggable Draggable system with autoscrolling superpowers.

🧘 &nbsp; **Blissful DX**

Comes with strong types, smart defaults and prebaked solutions for common use cases.

🎁 &nbsp; **Tiny and Modular**

Weighs around 11kB gzipped all in all, but you can use only the bits and pieces you need.

🍦 &nbsp; **Vanilla Flavour**

No frameworks were abused while writing this library. It's all vanilla framework-free TS down to the core.

💝 &nbsp; **Free & Open Source**
