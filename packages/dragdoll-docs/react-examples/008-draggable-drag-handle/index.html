    <title>Draggable - Drag Handle</title>
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="A simple example on how to create a drag handle. There is no built-in 'handle' option, because it would be too limiting. In this example the `PointerSensor` is used for the handle element while the `KeyboardMotionSensor` is used normally for the draggable element. You could also create the `KeyboardMotionSensor` for the handle element if you wished, it's really up to your preferences. Hopefully this showcases how flexible and customizable DragDoll really is with its sensor system."
