      content="Draggable automagically handles (2D) transformed ancestors and the dragged element itself, out of the box, performantly. The draggable element is always guaranteed to move in sync with the active sensor, to the same direction and the same distance, regardless of any CSS transforms or zoom in any part of the document. In this example we showcase a scenario where the draggable element is within two differently transformed containers with different transform origins and uses a differently transformed drag container that's also wrapped in an extra transformed container. The draggable element itself also has transforms applied."
