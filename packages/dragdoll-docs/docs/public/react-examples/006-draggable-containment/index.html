      content="A simple demo on how to use the built-in containment modifier. The first argument of `createContainmentModifier` should be a function that returns the client rect of the containment area. That function is called on every drag 'move' event and also on 'start' and 'end' events. The second argument is a boolean whose value is cached on start event to define if the modifier should track drifting of the sensor when the dragged element hits an edge of the containment area and the sensor keeps on moving away. If the drift is being tracked the draggable element will not be moved to the opposing direction until the sensor is back inside the containment area. By default the drift is tracked only for `PointerSensor`."
