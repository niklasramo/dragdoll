# What is DragDoll React?

DragDoll React is a thin and performant React wrapper for the [DragDoll](/dragdoll/) drag and drop library. It provides React hooks and components that give you declarative access to the full DragDoll API while minimizing re-renders and maintaining excellent performance.

At its core, DragDoll React is built on top of the vanilla DragDoll library. It exposes React components and hooks that abstract away the imperative DragDoll API into a declarative React paradigm, making it easy to integrate drag and drop functionality into your React applications.
